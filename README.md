# Longan_GD32VF_examples
example project for Longan Nano (GD32VF) in the platformio environment. 

Adapted my small OLED library which is capable of displaying the two fonts
(an 8x8px and 8x16px font) in three sizes each, by upscaling them with the
simple-but-fast [scale2x and scale3x](https://scale2x.it) algorithm. 

Very alpha, just to get the hang of it.
